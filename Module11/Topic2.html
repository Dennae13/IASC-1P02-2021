<h2 id="Magic12" align="left"> Clothing </h2>
<p class="blueEffect"> Paris is famous for housing many high-end fashion lines like Dior, Hermes, Louis Vuitton and Chanel (Zimmermann, 2017). As stated before, French people are known for dressing fashionably sophisticated and professional, their outfits include suits, long coats, nice dresses, scarves and berets (Zimmermann, 2017). A term called <em>“haute couture”</em> is used for fancier garments that are handmade or made to order; this term is mostly used when referring to French fashion (Zimmermann, 2017). The French take this term very seriously as it is protected by law, a London-based fashion writer and editor says there’s a set of rules that must be met to be known or called a couture house (Zimmermann, 2017). They must follow the following: </p>

<ol class="blueEffect">
	<li>Design made-to-order for private clients, with one or more fittings.</li>
	<li>Have a workshop (atelier) in Paris that employs at least 15 people full-time</li>
	<li>Each season (i.e. twice a year) present a collection to the Paris press, comprising at least 35 runs/exits with outfits for both daytime wear and evening wear" (Zimmermann, 2017).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Magic13" align="left"> French Art </h2>

<p class="blueEffect"> There are several different types of art pieces around Paris. Many churches and public buildings have Gothic, Romanesque Rococo and Neoclassic influences (Zimmermann, 2017). Artists like Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Camille Pissarro found their inspiration in Paris, which gave rise to the Impression Movement (Zimmermann, 2017). The Impression Movement was an art movement that started in the late 1800s, Parisian painters wanted to go against classical/traditional works and embrace a new modernized style (History.com Editors, 2018). The Louvre Museum found in Paris is one of the largest museums that houses famous art works like the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo (Zimmermann, 2017). </p>
